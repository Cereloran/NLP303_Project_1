This is your servant Ailon Norsk.\" \"Your servant to the Windhelm.\" Then the dragon disappeared, bringing all the light to the city, where the citizens would once again rejoice, and a new day should soon come. The fire that consumed it reached its height and consumed the whole ground, and as water vapor and ice engulfed the clouds, the city was turned into a lake, where every single family, city, and city began anew, and in the midst of that there arose an army, led by Ailon Norsk's son Ailon I the High Lord of the High Winds. Within the city they found the dragon that came before them! And Ailon I's men were brought to his throne, where they placed them in his command and the high lords of the city heard about his victory. Ailon I said, \"Now we will wait in ambush!\" so the city's inhabitants were able to march against the dragon with ease. After the battle, both the city's inhabitants and the servants of the city grew to the peak of greatness. The city went up in glory, until it became a new city. But Ailon Norsk, whose son Ailon I had already brought to his throne, turned the city into a lake! The wind gave way now, and now it was turned into a lake. With its full force the winds of the lake blew, and once again the dragon was raised from the sky. Ailon Norsk turned the city into an unquenchable lake and poured into it a great flood of blood! Now in the darkness were the bloodthirsty dragons and the dragons of the night, and they attacked so that the city was turned into nothing more than a black lake, so that, before any more time had passed, the night would turn to day and the day again to day, and nothing would remain in its depths. The bloodshed that the bloodthirsty dragons had brought to the river would not last long and never be seen.
